## Oracle server keep-alive script

This project provides optional CPU, memory, and bandwidth occupiers for low-load servers.
All runtime scripts are POSIX `sh` compatible and can also be launched with `bash`.

## Compatibility

- Linux: Debian, Ubuntu, RHEL/CentOS/Oracle Linux/AlmaLinux/Rocky, Fedora, Amazon Linux, Arch, Alpine, openSUSE/SLES, Void, Gentoo, and other distributions with standard POSIX userland.
- BSD: FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD, DragonFly BSD, and other BSD systems with `cron` and standard POSIX tools.
- Scheduling: Linux with systemd uses systemd services and timer; non-systemd Linux and BSD use a cron supervisor.
- Package managers: `apt-get`, `dnf`, `yum`, `microdnf`, `zypper`, `apk`, `pacman`, `pkg`, `pkg_add`, `pkgin`, `xbps-install`, `emerge`.

Platform differences are handled defensively. For example, BSD uses cron instead of systemd; if no speedtest tool is available, bandwidth download mode falls back to a default estimated rate.

## Install

Run with `sh`:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://gitlab.com/spiritysdx/Oracle-server-keep-alive-script/-/raw/main/oalive.sh -o oalive.sh
chmod +x oalive.sh
sh oalive.sh
```

Run with `bash`:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://gitlab.com/spiritysdx/Oracle-server-keep-alive-script/-/raw/main/oalive.sh -o oalive.sh
chmod +x oalive.sh
bash oalive.sh
```

From a local clone:

```sh
sh oalive.sh
```

The installer needs root privileges to install services, cron entries, config files, and log directories.

## Menu

- `1`: Install or reinstall keep-alive services
- `2`: Uninstall keep-alive services
- `3`: Update installer script
- `4`: Exit

You can also use CLI arguments:

```sh
sh oalive.sh --install
sh oalive.sh --uninstall
sh oalive.sh --status
sh oalive.sh --update
```

## Features

- CPU: Uses a POSIX-native workload loop by default. On 2 to 4 cores, default quota is `cores * 20%`; otherwise default is `25%`. On systemd hosts, `CPUQuota` is also written as a second limit.
- Memory: Target is `25%` of total memory by default, with 300 seconds hold and 300 seconds rest. It reads Linux `/proc/meminfo` or BSD `sysctl`, and limits allocation by writable temp space.
- Bandwidth: Runs every 45 minutes by default, downloads for up to 6 minutes, and uses 30% of measured bandwidth. Custom mode supports fixed Mbps, duration, and interval.
- Scheduler: systemd hosts install `cpu-limit.service`, `memory-limit.service`, and `bandwidth_occupier.timer`; cron hosts install `oalive-cron-runner.sh` supervisor.
- Safety: Atomic directory locks are used in all tasks to avoid duplicate runs. Uninstall stops tasks by lock and exact script path instead of fuzzy process matching.
- Logging: Logs go to `/var/log/oalive`; each file rotates at 128 KiB by default.
- Runtime messages: Installer, status, error, and runtime logs include both Chinese and English text.

## Paths

- Config: `/etc/oalive/oalive.conf`
- Enabled flags: `/etc/oalive/enabled.conf`
- Logs: `/var/log/oalive/`
- State: `/var/lib/oalive/`
- Runtime locks: `/tmp/oalive-*.lock`
- Runtime scripts: `/usr/local/bin/cpu-limit.sh`, `/usr/local/bin/memory-limit.sh`, `/usr/local/bin/bandwidth_occupier.sh`, `/usr/local/bin/oalive-cron-runner.sh`

## Uninstall

```sh
sh oalive.sh --uninstall
```

Uninstall stops systemd services or removes cron entries, then cleans scripts, config, state files, and locks. Re-running uninstall is safe.

## Customization

Edit `/etc/oalive/oalive.conf` after install, then reload scheduler settings.

systemd:

```sh
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl restart cpu-limit.service memory-limit.service
systemctl restart bandwidth_occupier.timer
```

cron:

```sh
sh /usr/local/bin/oalive-cron-runner.sh --check
```

For manual cron scheduling examples, see [README_CRON_EN.md](README_CRON_EN.md).

## Notes

Resource activity does not guarantee any cloud-provider retention outcome.
This project only provides controlled, removable, low-risk occupier tasks.
Use it according to your provider terms and your real workload needs.
